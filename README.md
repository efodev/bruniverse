#### Idea changes:

-   Make a change to include one role related route point that calls to other specific function to handle routes.
-   Send client release to db service classes and remove finally from query method.

## Todo: Main Posting page

-   Create interface for comments that removes the category
-   that should be absolutely postioned
-   User can add tags below their questions
-   center the leftside option buttons
-

## Backend

-   Move the backend to express and use the db format I created for edu-platform.
-   instead of store user-data via session storage, it better to keep the sessions token for that.
-   Make good use of middleware just as in the edu-platform.

- Cache static UI compose like category options, etc and serve them via the server.
